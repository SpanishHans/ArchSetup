### Introduction

This is my installer for Arch Linux. It sets up a BTRFS system and full snapper support (both snapshotting and rollback work!).

The script is a fork of [Arch-Setup-Script](https://github.com/TommyTran732/Arch-Setup-Script/tree/main), which itself is based on [easy-arch](https://github.com/classy-giraffe/easy-arch). However, some changes are made to remove disk encryption and the hardenind done in [Arch-Setup-Script](https://github.com/TommyTran732/Arch-Setup-Script/tree/main). Some inspiration and changes are taken from the following [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maIu1d2lAiI) and from [This guide](https://sysguides.com/install-fedora-41-with-snapshot-and-rollback-support).

### How to use it?
1. Download an Arch Linux ISO from [here](https://archlinux.org/download/)
2. Flash the ISO onto an [USB Flash Drive](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_medium).
3. Boot the live environment.
4. Connect to the internet. iwcli for wifi. auto for ethernet. (Get the custom iso with extra tools from: [Repo Release](https://github.com/SpanishHans/Archsetup/releases) and then run `chmod +x /root/NetworkInstaller.sh && /root/NetworkInstaller.sh`)
5. `git clone https://github.com/SpanishHans/ArchSetup/ && cd ArchSetup && chmod u+x ./install.sh && ./install.sh`
6. After install, reboot to system and log as root.

#### Note
1. All scripts must be run from the root user to avoid permission issues. 
2. Paru commands shall be ran as the syadmin user because mkpgk cant be ran as root.

### Snapper behavior
The partition layout I use allows us to replicate the behavior found in openSUSE ðŸ¦Ž
1. Snapper-rollback <number> works! You will no longer need to manually rollback from a live USB like you would with the @ and @home layout suggested in the Arch Wiki.
3. Automatic snapshots on pacman install/update/remove operations
4. Directories such as `/var/log`, `/var/crash`, `/var/tmp`, `/var/spool`, `/var/lib/libvirt/images` are excluded from the snapshots as they either should be persistent or are just temporary files.# ArchSetup
